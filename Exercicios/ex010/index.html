<h1>GARAGE BALTHA</h1>
<p>Compared to the 997, the 991 is slightly larger, with the wheelbase increased by 100 mm (3.9 in) to 2,450 mm (96.5 in), and the overall length up by 70 mm (2.8 in) to 4,490 mm (176.8 in).[2] A new transaxle was developed so that the rear wheels could be moved 76 mm (3 in) backward in relation to the position of the engine, which significantly improves the weight distribution and cornering performance of the car.[3][4]

    Due to the use of high-strength steel, aluminium and some composites, the weight was reduced to 1,380 kg (3,042 lb) for the manual Carrera, rising to 1,605 kg (3,538 lb) for the all wheel drive Turbo model if equipped with the PDK transmission (Porsche Doppelkupplung). PDK is available as an option for all 911 Carrera and 911 Turbo (991.1 Non S) models as a 7-speed transmission, featuring manual and automatic modes. Gears 1 to 6 have a sports ratio and top speed is reached in 6th gear. 7th gear has a long ratio and helps to reduce fuel consumption by keeping engine revs low. The PDK is essentially two gearboxes merged into a single unit and thus requires two clutches. For all 991 models, the PDK is produced by ZF Friedrichshafen. The auto start/stop function is standard on all variants of the 911 Carrera.</p>

    <p>To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 911's introduction, Porsche introduced the 911 50th Anniversary Edition at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show for the 2014 model year.[11] 1,963 individually-numbered examples were produced. The 50th Anniversary Edition was based on the Carrera S, including the standard 400PS/394 hp 3.8L flat-6 and standard 7-speed manual with the 7-speed PDK transmission an available option. Contrary to the standard Carrera S, however, the 50th Anniversary Edition featured the Porsche Active Suspension Management system and Porsche Torque Vectoring as standard equipment.[12] The optional Powerkit increased the engine's output to 430PS/424 hp.

        Cosmetically, the 50th Anniversary Edition featured the wider body of the Carrera 4S,[13] 10mm lower suspension,[14] special 20" alloy wheels which reference the iconic Fuchs wheels on classic 911s,[15] chrome trim across the body including the vents on the rear engine cover and window trim, standard SportDesign side mirrors, and a special "911 50" rear badge. Three colors were available: Geyser Grey, Graphite Grey, and black monochrome.[16] On the interior, the 50th Anniversary Edition has vintage-style green instrument dials, white instrument dial needles, retro "houndstooth" seat inserts, and a badge on the trim above the glovebox commemorating the special edition and listing the production number of the vehicle.</p>

        <p>At the Detroit Motor Show in January 2014, Porsche introduced the Targa 4 and Targa 4S models. These new derivatives come equipped with an all-new roof technology with the original targa design, now with an electronically operated soft top along with the original B-pillar and the glass 'dome' at the rear.

            On 12 January 2015, Porsche announced the 911 Targa 4 GTS at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Similar in appearance to the existing Targa 4 and 4S models, the GTS added the 430 PS (316 kW; 424 bhp) engine plus several otherwise optional features.[</p>
